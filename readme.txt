The GitHub repository containing all the project files including the index.html, ram.js (javascript file), and ram.css files can be found at url

Also, this html website which is hosted by github pages can be launched at url

Since this is a simple website the html file is the main driver and the contents of all the files on this project can be viewed on any text editor app, sublime text or notepad++ is preferred. All that needs to be done is to either launch the website through the github link given above: https://rjung00712.github.io/, or the client can double click on the index.html file after either cloning or downloading and extracting the zip file containing the project from the github repository.

Little-to-no programming knowledge or experience is required to be able to run this web page. No Integrated Development Environment (IDE) required, any common browser will do, even Internet Explorer though don't prefer it.

This is a project to showcase javascript and its complementary web scripting languages for this simple website for pizza lovers presented by team RAM - Richard Jung, Ashkan Ghafari, and Magloire Pungi for CS 408.
